# Why is deep-learning so rich of Expressivty?

### On Representation Power of Neural Network
> Before start, I would like to borrow a researcher's comment- How deep-learning work so well still in its infancy.. Yes, we still lack of theoretical understanding on defining what is neural nets' expressivity. The defintion is necessary and valuable since the clear definition of it will provides useful guidelines to our decision which neural network will we willing to use.

Main thesis:  "As a final piece of the story, note that the conversion between rational functions and ReLU networks is more seamless if instead one converts to rational networks, meaning neural networks where each activation function is a rational
function."
